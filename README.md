# personalRepo
Welcome to my personal repository. Here I store websites using HTML, CSS, and JS (and maybe a bit of C), that perform useful functions. I hope to fill this out over time, and will include descriptions of my projects in the source code, and here, ine the README. 

Project one: After working with a little bit of c, I learned about bubble sorting an array. It has occured to me that I could create an HTML list sorting webpage, and take this to the next level. Target audience, anyone needing to sort a list, from spelling students to parents planning shopping trips.
