Welcome to my personal repository. Here I store websites using HTML, CSS, and JS (and maybe a bit of C), that perform useful functions. I hope to fill this out over time, and will include descriptions of my projects in the source code, and here, ine the README. 

### SortOfAnApp

 After working with a little bit of C, I learned about bubble sorting an array. It has occured to me that I could create an HTML list sorting webpage, and take this to the next level through user interaction and JS. Target audience, anyone needing to sort a list, from spelling students to parents planning shopping trips.

*Update: SortOfAnApp is completed! Looking to style it with CSS later to make more appealing, but the basic structure and design is finished!*
